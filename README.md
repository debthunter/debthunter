  GENERAL INFORMATION
</h2>

<br>

<p align="center">
I encourage cuddles and hides, feel free to do so without asking! Please whisper me<br>
beforehand if you wish to sit next to me and I am already with a friend.
</p>

<p align="center">
Ships are also free to interact, although "DoubleFedora"<br> 
is only limited to my partner as I am not a fan.
</p>

<p align="center">
I may move around alot, especially if I am with a friend I'm comfortable with.<br>
I apologize since I dislike cuddles that I think would last long.
</p>

<p align="center">
I wouldn't consider myself as the most sociable and may be quiet,<br>
but I am okay with making friends. I am very friendly!
</p>

<p align="center">
I have no need to list the rest, I block freely.
</p>

  OTHER INFO
</h2>

<br>

<p align="center">
I am not a system, I just appear to have many fiction kins<br>
and coping-links. I am sorry if it appears that way.
</p>

<p align="center">
I may suddenly switch between typing quirks, (excluding numbers)<br>
depending on my mood, or for fun.
</p>

<p align="center">
Please ask if you want to take inspiration off any of my skins<br>
so I am aware that you are not trying to copy off me.
</p>
